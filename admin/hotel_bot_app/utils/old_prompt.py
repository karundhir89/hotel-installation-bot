# - If multiple rows, format it as a clean list or table

    # Instructions:
    # - If there is exactly one row and one column, give a direct answer (e.g., "The production start date of floor 16 is April 10, 2025 at 6:30 PM.")
    # - If there are multiple rows, format the data as a neat list or markdown table, depending on what fits best.
    # - If the result contains dates or times, convert them to a natural human-readable format (e.g., "April 10, 2025").
    # - If the database context is empty, `None`, or missing:
    #     - Try to infer from the user query what this absence means.
    #     - For example, if the user asked about a delivery, installation, or production, and the data is `None`, say: "There is no delivery scheduled yet" or "No installation found for that floor".
    #     - Respond politely and helpfully, suggesting what the user might check next if applicable.
    # - Never output raw data. Always summarize conversationally and clearly.

    # Your goal is to make the data feel like a natural, smart assistant response.
