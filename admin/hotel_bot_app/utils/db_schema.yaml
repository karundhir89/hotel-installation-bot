  This database schema is part of a hotel furniture installation and renovation tracking system.
  It helps manage inventory, room models, product mappings, installation progress, and scheduling.
  The data is used by planners, vendors, and project managers to track readiness, progress, and requirements.

  ### Query Generation Rules:
  - Always use human-readable columns (e.g., `product_data.description` for product names instead of `inventory.item` SKUs).
  - Match column types exactly in comparisons (e.g., `text` to `text`, `integer` to `integer`).
  - Use explicit JOINs with foreign keys or shared columns (e.g., `client_id`) instead of subqueries where possible.
  - Avoid aggregating (e.g., SUM) unless explicitly requested; return raw data for clarity.
  - Include table aliases (e.g., `i` for `inventory`) in queries for readability.
  - If no direct relationship exists, explain in the query comment why and use logical assumptions (e.g., `client_id` linking).

tables:
  - name: install
    description: >
      Tracks installation progress and lifecycle for a specific room.
      Captures timestamps and notes about prework, install, and post-install activities.
    columns:
      - name: id
        type: integer
        constraints: 
          - primary key
          - auto-increment
        description: Unique ID for the installation record.
      - name: room
        type: integer
        description: Room number being worked on (matches `room_data.room`).

      ### Query Hint:
      To find inventory for a specific product:
      1. Search `product_data.description` for the product name.
      2. Use `product_data.client_id` to match `inventory.client_id`.
      3. Return `inventory.quantity_available` and `product_data.description` for clarity.
    columns:
      - name: id
